This is simple tool to manage nVidia Pascal GPUs and ethminer.
It supports Over/Underclocking, Powerlimit setting and Auto adjusted target temperature with minimum  fanspeed.
Simply place and edit conf.json in /etc , place minermanager in /usr/local/bin and type "minermanager --help".
All you see is what you get. If you like this tool feel free to send some beers to my BTC Address: 172BTaR7kwHhHGfqYkirW1SeuwbNzXf3fX
